  <h1>Embedded Systems and IoT</h1>
  <main>
    <p>
      I have had an interest in building electronic devices since I began playing with electronics
      kits as a child (thanks, <a href="http://williammeisel.com/">Dad</a>!). As a result, despite
      my focus on software as an undergraduate at
      <a href="https://cs.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a>, I still took what hardware classes I
      could. I have fond memories of a
      <a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs150/sp01/">digital design course</a>, where we were
      tasked with building a Tetris-like game using a Xilinx FPGA (pre-Verilog, just using
      schematics!) controlled by a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_64_controller">Nintendo 64 controller</a>.
      Someone had already reverse-engineered the basic line protocol for these controllers, but the
      protocol for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumble_Pak">Rumble Pak</a>, which
      makes the controller vibrate, was still a bit of a mystery (at least at the time).
      <a href="http://bnrg.eecs.berkeley.edu/~randy/">Professor Katz</a> was offering extra credit
      for anyone who got it to work. My project partner
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffpang/">Jeffrey Pang</a> and I decided to give it a
      try. We hadn't thought much of it other than being a fun way to get some extra credit, but
      it turned out we were the only group in the class that managed to get it working!

      Though I continued to toy with electronics design through the years, I finally undertook a
      serious effort to build a project from start to finish in 2017, during some time off between
      full-time jobs. I used <a href="/art/timer.html">a toy project</a> as a way to teach myself
      about PCB design, machining, microprocessor firmware, and refreshing my basic electronics
      knowledge.

      In 2020, I joined <a href="https://swarm.space">Swarm</a> (now part of
      <a href="https://www.spacex.com/">SpaceX</a>), a startup building tiny satellites for
      affordable IoT connectivity. Though I did not work on hardware or firmware at Swarm, by the
      time I left, I had learned much from my colleagues and our customers about the IoT industry
      and how embedded systems are designed.

      I have continued to use and refine this knowledge as a hobbyist, artist, and instructor. I
      helped to create an Arduino-driven <a href="/art/shrine.html">player piano</a> for a Burning
      Man art project and a lighting system for <a href="/art/hammer.html">an art installation</a>
      at <a href="https://grayarea.org/">Gray Area</a> in San Francisco. I have also been teaching
      the week on advanced Arduino techniques at
      <a href="https://grayarea.org/course/creative-code-immersive/">Gray Area&rsquo;s Creative Code
      Immersive</a> since spring 2020.
