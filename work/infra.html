  <h1>Internet Infrastructure</h1>
  <main>
    <p>
      My interest in the inner workings of the internet began in the spring of 2007, when my friend
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenster112/">Daniel Jen</a> suggested we take
      <a href="https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~lixia/">Professor Lixia Zhang</a>&rsquo;s graduate-level
      course on internet research together. Dan and I collaborated on the course project, an
      ambitious proposal to tweak the core infrastructure of the internet for better scalability.
      This proposal became
      <a
        href="https://irl.cs.ucla.edu/data/files/techreports/ucla-cs-tr080004.pdf"
      >APT: A practical tunneling architecture for routing scalability</a>,
      a project which would lead us both to spend the rest of our graduate school careers working
      with Professor Zhang in her <a href="https://irl.cs.ucla.edu/">Internet Research Lab</a>.

    <p>
      We
      <a href="https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/69/slides/RRG-5.pdf">presented</a> our proposal to
      the Internet Engineering Task Force&rsquo;s
      <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/rg/rrg/about/">Routing Research Group</a> at their
      semiannual meeting in November, 2007, but it never received much traction. This work has been
      subsumed by <a href="https://named-data.net">Named Data Networking (NDN)</a>, which solves a
      much larger infrastructure problem in a much more clever way, sweeping up scalability issues
      in its wake.
    </p>
    <p>
      I subsequently switched my research focus to
      <a href="wireless.html">wireless networks</a> (and how to apply NDN in that context). However,
      the majority of my labmates were still focused on internet infrastructure, and in particular
      on measuring the real network. Two of these labmates were
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohitlad/">Mohit Lad</a> and
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rveloso/">Ricardo Oliveira</a>, which is how I came to be
      the first employee at their startup, <a href="https://thousandeyes.com">ThousandEyes</a> (now
      part of <a href="https://cisco.com">Cisco</a>) in 2010.
    </p>
    <p>
      ThousandEyes continued in the same vein of network measurement, analysis, and visualization
      as Mohit and Ricardo&rsquo;s work at UCLA, but building commercial products. Our first product
      was a novel system for monitoring the Domain Name System (DNS), a product for which I built
      the entire measurement and data collection system. This code ran with little modification and
      minimal maintenance for years (at least from 2010 through 2017), continuously providing data
      to some of the world&rsquo;s largest tech companies.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was also the sole developer of ThousandEyes Path Visualization from its inception through
      the first few years. Path Visualization is a sort of visual multi-point-to-multi-point
      traceroute, inferring the topology of the relevant slice of the internet from multiple
      independent measurements. Path Visualization is still a flagship part of the ThousandEyes
      product to this day, retaining most of the basic concepts and visual elements of the original
      version.

    <p>
      As the years went on, I took on a bigger <a href="leadership.html">leadership</a> role and
      did less and less of the coding myself. Instead, I had the privilege of building and working
      with an incredible team that, thanks in no small part to Ricardo&rsquo;s unmatched creativity
      as CTO, continued to develop novel network data collection, troubleshooting, data analysis,
      and visualization techniques.
