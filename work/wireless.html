  <h1>Wireless Networks</h1>
  <main>
    <p>
      My first professional exposure to wireless networks was at
      <a href="https://inveneo.org">Inveneo</a>, where our mission was to bring computers,
      telephones, and the internet to rural and highly underserved communities around the world.
      When it came time for our first deployment (in rural Uganda), it was an all-hands-on-deck sort
      of affair. We all chipped in setting up computers, solar panels, and a long-distance,
      point-to-point WiFi network between rooftops.

    <p>
      The power of networks, wireless ones in particular, stuck with me from my Inveneo days. Which
      is probably part of the reason I was drawn to them as a research topic in my final two years
      at UCLA.
    </p>
    <p>
      In particular, I became interested in
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence">emergence</a> in complex systems, and how it
      could be applied to network protocols. This began with an exploration of
      <a href="https://irl.cs.ucla.edu/data/files/papers/meisel2009services.pdf">how to design
      emergent services for wireless networks</a> in 2009, which was mostly a thought exercise and
      only published as a university technical report. However, I quickly realized that emergent
      behavior was a common property of complex biological systems, and decided to do a deep dive
      into network protocols inspired by biology. The result was
      <a href="http://irl.cs.ucla.edu/data/files/papers/meisel2010bio.pdf">a survey paper</a>
      on the topic.

      At the time, my advisor, <a href="https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~lixia/">Professor Lixia Zhang</a>,
      was just beginning an ambitious new research project called
      <a href="https://named-data.net/">Named Data Networking</a>. NDN asserts that data, not hosts,
      are the central element of modern networks. This suggests a radically different approach to
      network routing: rather than asking for a particular server by address, ask for the data you
      want by name. The data could be at any location. This allows any device in the network to
      cache data and provide it to nearby nodes upon request.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up until this point, my work on wireless networks had been concerned with <i>physical</i>
      mobility of devices. However, we quickly realized that the same techniques could be naturally
      extended to the <i>logical</i> mobility of content under the NDN model. In fact,
      <a href="http://irl.cs.ucla.edu/data/files/papers/meisel2010adhoc.pdf">we argue</a> that NDN
      is a <i>better</i> model for ad hoc networks than the traditional IP stack.
    </p>
    <p>
      The culmination of my work was a new, multi-hop routing protocol for ad hoc wireless networks.
      Initially called Listen First, Broadcast Later (LFBL), I later renamed it to Broadcast-Only
      Named Data (BOND) after my collaborators (rightly) complained about the unpronounceability of
      the acronym. BOND turned out to be the first complete protocol specification based on the NDN
      model. The protocol is probably best explained in <a href="/docs/bond-slides.pdf">the slide
      deck from my Ph.D. defense</a>.

    <p>
      Years later, out of a desire to work on wireless network protocols again, I joined
      <a href="https://swarm.space">Swarm</a> (now part of
      <a href="https://www.spacex.com/">SpaceX</a>), a startup building tiny satellites for
      affordable IoT connectivity. Though I never got a chance to work on their protocols directly
      (primarily spending my time building their customer-facing
      <!-- <a href="web.html">web application</a>), -->
      web application),
      I learned a great deal about satellite communications
      from the incredible team there.
