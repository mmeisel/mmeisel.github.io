  <h1>Technology for Social Good</h1>
  <main>
    <p>
      I honestly had never given much thought to how technology could help lift people out of
      poverty until I attended a conference on the subject in 2004. As inspiring as the talks were,
      the lunch break was the reason I spent the next three years working in the sector. By chance,
      I sat down next to
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-summer/">Mark Summer</a>, who had recent
      co-founded a non-profit called
      <a href="https://inveneo.org">Inveneo</a> (with
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bob-marsh-b4a434/">Bob Marsh</a>
      and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristin-peterson-5165211/">Kristin Peterson</a>).
      By the end of lunch, I was sold on their mission to bring computers, telephones, and
      the internet to rural and highly underserved communities around the world. Soon I was their
      first full-time employee.

      My primary responsibility at Inveneo was to design and build Inveneo Linux, a full-featured,
      zero-maintenance desktop Linux distribution that fit in 256MB of flash memory &mdash; a
      necessity to ensure we could build low-power, zero-maintenance desktop computers with no
      moving parts. However, being the tiny organization that it was at the time, deployments were
      an all-hands-on-deck sort of affair. As a result, I participated in (and occasionally even
      led) five successful deployments in east Africa. These deployments involved setting up school
      computer labs, rural point-to-point wireless networks, and the power systems to support them.

      As I write this in 2022, after a successful stint in network research and Silicon Valley
      startups, it is my intention to return to this kind of work &mdash; increasing global access
      to free and open communications, information sharing, and digital tools.
