  <h1>Technology for Social Good</h1>
  <main>
    <p>
      Early on in my career, I attended a conference on using technology to fight poverty. During
      lunch, I happened to sit down next to
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-summer/">Mark Summer</a>, who had just co-founded
      (along with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bob-marsh-b4a434/">Bob Marsh</a> and
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristin-peterson-5165211/">Kristin Peterson</a>) a
      non-profit called <a href="https://inveneo.org">Inveneo</a>. Their mission was to bring
      computers, telephones, and the internet to rural and highly underserved communities around the
      world. I told him I wanted to help and began volunteering for them. A few months later, I
      was their first full-time, paid employee.

      My primary responsibility at Inveneo was to design and build Inveneo Linux, a full-featured,
      zero-maintenance desktop Linux distribution that fit in 256MB of flash memory &mdash; a
      necessity to ensure we could build low-power, zero-maintenance desktop computers with no
      moving parts. However, being the tiny organization that it was at the time, deployments were
      an all-hands-on-deck sort of affair. As a result, I participated in (and occasionally even
      led) five successful deployments in east Africa. These deployments involved setting up school
      computer labs, rural point-to-point wireless networks, and the power systems to support them.

      As I write this in 2022, after a successful stint in network research and Silicon Valley
      startups, it is my intention to return to this kind of work &mdash; increasing global access
      to free and open communications, information sharing, and digital tools.
