  <h1>Leadership and Team Building (2012-)</h1>
  <main>
    <p>
      My first and most formative leadership role was at
      <a href="https://thousandeyes.com">ThousandEyes</a>, where, as the first employee, I helped
      build the product and the engineering team from the ground up. At the beginning of 2014, after
      having led the web application team for some time, I took on the role of VP of Engineering.
      In that role, I led the software engineering, site reliability engineering, and product design
      teams. I grew these teams to a total of 36 employees in two offices (San Francisco and London).
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the course of 7.5 years, I learned a great deal about how to build and scale an
      engineering team, a highly technical product, and, through my role on the executive team, a
      company. I am incredibly proud of what we built, but even more so of the phenomenal team
      that built it.

      I applied this knowledge in my next two roles. At <a href="https://rideos.ai/">rideOS</a> (now
      part of <a href="https://gopuff.com/">gopuff</a>), I advised the founders on engineering
      team structure, engineering management, business strategy, marketing, product strategy, and
      recruiting. I built two teams: web applications and, after proposing its creation to the
      founders, partner engineering. At <a href="https://swarm.space">Swarm</a> (now part of
      <a href="https://www.spacex.com/">SpaceX</a>), I led the fledgling Cloud Services team,
      responsible for all of the software used to transmit messages across the internet and make
      them available to customers once they were received from Swarm's network of tiny satellites.
