    <p>
      Michael Meisel is a technologist, team builder, and artist who is passionate about finding
      simple solutions to complex problems. He has spent his career helping startups build their
      core technologies and teams from the ground up. He has built everything from interactive
      computer network visualizations to zero-maintenance, solar-powered PCs for rural areas in the
      developing world.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an artist, Michael is interested in making tangible, technological artifacts that are
      indistinguishable from magic. This presents opportunities to showcase the power of technology
      as an instrument of both good and evil. His aesthetic is best described as minimalist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Michael holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from UCLA (with a focus in network protocols) and a
      B.A. in Computer Science from UC Berkeley.

    <h4>Current Work</h4>
    <p>
      I am currently available for advisory positions or consulting, particular for non-profits and
      social enterprises, but for young startups as well.
    <p>
      Artistically, I am currently working with the
      <a href="https://grayarea.org/">Gray Area Foundation for the Arts</a>, both as a course
      instructor for
      <a href="https://grayarea.org/course/creative-code-immersive/">their educational program</a>
      and as a member of their
      <a href="https://grayarea.org/create/individual-membership/">artist incubator</a>. I am also
      interested in artistic collaborations and helping artists to incorporate physical computing
      into their work.
    </p>
