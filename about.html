    <p>
      I am a technologist, team builder, and artist who is passionate about finding simple solutions
      to complex problems. I have spent my career helping startups build their core technologies and
      teams from the ground up. I have built everything from interactive computer network
      visualizations to zero-maintenance, solar-powered PCs for rural areas in the developing world.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an artist, I am interested in making tangible, technological artifacts that are
      indistinguishable from magic. This presents opportunities to showcase the power of technology
      as an instrument of both good and evil. My aesthetic is best described as minimalist.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from UCLA (with a focus in network protocols) and a B.A. in
      Computer Science from UC Berkeley.
    </p>
    <h4>Current Work</h4>
    <p>
      I am currently available for advisory positions or consulting, particular for non-profits and
      social enterprises, but for young startups as well. I am based in the San Francisco Bay Area
      but available for remote work.
    <p>
      Artistically, I am currently working with the
      <a href="https://grayarea.org/">Gray Area Foundation for the Arts</a>, both as a course
      instructor for
      <a href="https://grayarea.org/course/creative-code-immersive/">their educational program</a>
      and as a member of their
      <a href="https://grayarea.org/create/individual-membership/">artist incubator</a>. I am also
      interested in artistic collaborations and helping artists to incorporate physical computing
      into their work.
