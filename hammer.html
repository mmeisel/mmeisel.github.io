      Part of <a href="https://endofyou.io/">THE END OF YOU</a> exhibition,
      THIS HAMMER (as described by the artist) is a kinetic memorial to the ongoing radioactive
      cleanup crisis in San Francisco’s Hunters Point and the recent discovery of a highly
      radioactive object in a parcel of Hunters Point (that had been declared safe since 2004).
      Named after James Baldwin’s 1963 KQED documentary about Bayview–Hunters Point, THIS
      HAMMER is comprised of 25 paper lanterns (one for each three years since the nuclear
      contamination of Hunters Point) inscribed with headlines from the Bay Area’s oldest
      Black newspaper, the San Francisco Bayview. As viewers approach the object its radiation
      signature responds, illuminating the lanterns with increasing intensity and color, and
      challenging us to consider living with the chemical Body Burden of inhabiting a toxic
      environment — one which our Black neighbors have endured for almost a decade. What
      happens when we lay our Burden down? Who will carry the weight?

      Built with Arduino Unos, WS2812 LED strips, vellum, and ethernet cables.
      In consultation with the lead artist, <a href="http://nikiselken.com/">Niki Selken</a> and I
      designed and built the software and electronics for this piece. I also assisted in its
      construction and installation.
