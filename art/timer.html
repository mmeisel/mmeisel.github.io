  <h1>Slide Timer (2017-2018)</h1>

      Think of consumer electronics today and you imagine a sea of blinking blue LEDs, backlit
      screens, and digital beeps. Even something as simple as a kitchen timer bears no resemblance
      to its mechanical predecessors. The slide timer asks, does a digital mechanism necessitate
      digital design? Or can we combine the precision and convenience of a digital device with the
      simplicity and aesthetics of an analog one?

      The slide timer is a fully functional kitchen timer inspired by spring-driven, mechanical
      twist timers. To operate, one simply slides the knob to the desired time. The knob moves
      towards zero on its own to indicate the time remaining. When it reaches zero, a bell sounds.
      To turn it off, one slides the knob below zero. There are no other controls.

      The timer is powered by a custom PCB with an ATmega328P microcontroller, custom, Arduino-based
      software, 4 AA batteries, a speaker, and a motorized slide potentiometer. The enclosure is
      constructed from laser-cut bamboo plywood, a laser-cut (and engraved) acrylic panel, a stock
      slide knob, wood glue, and magnets.
