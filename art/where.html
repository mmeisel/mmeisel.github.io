      We have faced a pivotal moment in our history &mdash; the changes wrought by the Coronavirus
      pandemic are going to be deep and long lasting. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, less
      than 30% of workers are willing to return to offices and companies are finding that work from
      home is just as productive, if not more so, than working in an office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Housing costs are at all time highs just at a moment when office occupancies are at all time
      lows. How will our economic system, which relies so much on creative destruction, respond to
      such an imbalance? Inevitably, there are going to be major changes.

      The conversion of office space to residential is going to be a hotly contested market and only
      those companies with the of best of breed offerings will succeed. We imagined a company called
      Meta Homes and Gardens could arise from the smoldering heap of the office real estate market
      and offer solutions by converting offices into homes and make them as enticing as possible.

      Here to introduce Meta Homes and Gardens is Jason.

      This was the first piece to be installed in
      <a href="https://grayarea.org/visit/gallery/">Gray Area's permanent gallery space</a>. It was
      featured on their gallery page (and still is at the time of writing) as part of the
      <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220809225651/https://grayarea.org/visit/gallery/">
        original announcement</a>
      about the opening of the gallery.
