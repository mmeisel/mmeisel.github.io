      An installation inside the <a href="https://soundcave.org/">Shrine of Sympathetic Resonance</a>
      (by <a href="https://soundcave.org/">Tyson Ayers</a>) at Burning Man 2019, this player piano
      played MIDI files on a real piano. The piano hammers are actuated with servos controlled by an
      Arduino Uno. I participated in the design and construction of the mechanism, then went on to
      design and build much of the software that powers it.

      More about the larger piece (as described by the artist): The Shrine of Sympathetic Resonance
      immerses participants in the phenomena of 20,000 musical strings sympathetically resonating
      the sounds they make while inside. The wonder & joy induced by this experience invites
      participants to play with their own sounds by singing, laughing, crying, or howling.
