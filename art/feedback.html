  <h1>We value your feedback. (2022)</h1>
  <main>
    <p>
      We are always working to make our exhibits better. Your feedback helps us to provide a more
      fulfilling experience for your fellow patrons. By interacting with this kiosk, you consent to
      have your contribution used for any and all artistic purposes. The artists find your input
      invaluable, thank you.

      Inspired by the feedback kiosks sometimes found in public restrooms,
      &ldquo;We value your feedback.&rdquo; is a speculative design piece that is meant to be both
      appealing and appalling. A kiosk sits in front of a nondescript wall. The visitor is drawn to
      the kiosk by a brightly lit sign reading &ldquo;How do you feel?&rdquo; On the kiosk are four
      large, eminently pressable emoji buttons &mdash; a happy face, a neutral face, a slightly
      unhappy face, and an angry face.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a visitor presses one of the buttons, the kiosk visibly acknowledges their contribution.
      Invisibly, they are being surveilled by a camera as they approach and interact with the kiosk.
      The camera feed is clearly visible on the other side of the wall for everyone to see. When
      they press a button, the kiosk takes their photo and uses software developed at Facebook to
      perform facial attribute analysis. The software uses AI to &ldquo;determine&rdquo; their age,
      gender, race, and current emotion, which are displayed along with their photo on the other
      side of the wall. Their stated emotion (based on their button press) is compared to their
      &ldquo;actual&rdquo; emotion (as determined by the AI). Liars are visibly flagged. Aggregate
      statistics are also collected and displayed.

      The piece is meant to invite others to become voyeurs, hiding behind the wall and watching
      as their fellow visitors approach. A few well-placed chairs encourage this behavior.

      Far more intriguing is what happens when button-pressing visitors discover their image on the
      other side of the wall. Some are horrified at being unwittingly surveiled. But many are
      excited, seeing it as a new game. They proceed to attempt to &ldquo;look&rdquo; their age and
      gender, or exaggerate their facial expression so that the AI reads it &ldquo;correctly.&rdquo;
      Upon reflection, we are forced to reckon with how little it takes for even the most
      rudimentary AI to control human behavior.
