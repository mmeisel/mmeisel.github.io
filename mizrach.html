    Mizrach (2018)

      This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mizrah">mizrach</a> is a reproduction of an
      original work by my maternal great-great-grandfather, Yitzhak Reifman. The original was hand
      cut from shirt cardboard around the turn of the 20th century. Many of my family members have
      reproduced it in various forms over the years. I decided to continue this tradition using a
      distinctly early-21st century process: laser cutting. Though the technology (and level of
      effort required!) are quite different, I found it meaningful that the process — systematically
      cutting pieces out of a solid, flat material — is fundamentally unchanged.

      To create this reproduction, I digitally traced a photograph of an old analog tracing from
      before the original was damaged. I created a vector outline from this tracing and sent it to
      <a href="https://www.ponoko.com/">Ponoko</a> to be laser cut from bamboo plywood.
