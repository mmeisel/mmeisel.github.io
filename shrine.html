      An installation inside the <a href="https://soundcave.org/">Shrine of Sympathetic Resonance</a>
      (by Tyson Ayers) at Burning Man 2019, this player piano played MIDI files on a real piano.
      The piano hammers are actuated with servos controlled by an Arduino Uno.

      More about the larger piece: The Shrine of Sympathetic Resonance immerses participants in the
      phenomena of 20,000 musical strings sympathetically resonating the sounds they make while
      inside. The wonder & joy induced by this experience invites participants to play with their
      own sounds by singing, laughing, crying, or howling.
